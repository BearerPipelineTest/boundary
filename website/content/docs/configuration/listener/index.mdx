# `listener` Stanza

The `listener` stanza configures the addresses and ports on which Boundary will
respond to requests. At this time, there are two listener types:
[TCP](/docs/configuration/listener/tcp) and [Unix](/docs/configuration/listener/unix).


## `listener` Purpose

The `purpose` field is used to determine what part of Boundary's functionality is
started and exposed for a given listener block. Each listener must have a `purpose` set.

Currently, Boundary recognizes the following listener purposes:

- `api`: Starts up and exposes Boundary's controller API.
  At least one `api` listener must be present if a `cluster`
  purpose listener is present. By default, it runs on `:9200`.

- `cluster`: Starts up and exposes Boundary's worker and
  controller communication layer. Only one `cluster` listener
  is allowed per Boundary instance. Must be present if an `api`
  purpose listener is present. By default, it runs on `:9201`.

- `proxy`: Starts up a Boundary Worker. By default, it runs
on `:9202`.

- `ops`: Starts up and exposes Boundary's operational
endpoints (eg: /health). By default, it runs on `:9203`.
